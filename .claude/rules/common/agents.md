## Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. XR feature requests → Use **xr-specialist** agent
2. Code just written/modified → Use **lead-programmer** for review
3. Performance concerns → Use **performance-analyst** agent
4. Platform-specific issues → Use **platform-specialist** agent
5. SDK API changes → Use **sdk-developer** agent

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel agent execution for independent operations:

```markdown
# GOOD: Parallel execution
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: XR interaction review
2. Agent 2: Performance analysis
3. Agent 3: Cross-platform compatibility check

# BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
First agent 1, then agent 2, then agent 3
```
