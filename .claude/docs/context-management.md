# Context Management

Context is the most critical resource in a Claude Code session. Manage it actively.

## File-Backed State (Primary Strategy)

**The file is the memory, not the conversation.** Conversations are ephemeral and
will be compacted or lost. Files on disk persist across compactions and session crashes.

### Key Principle

After any disruption (compaction, crash, `/clear`), re-read the files you were
working on. The files contain the decisions; the conversation history is secondary.

### Incremental File Writing

When creating multi-section documents (design docs, architecture docs, lore entries):

1. Create the file immediately with a skeleton (all section headers, empty bodies)
2. Discuss and draft one section at a time in conversation
3. Write each section to the file as soon as it's approved
4. Update the session state file after each section
5. After writing a section, previous discussion about that section can be safely
   compacted — the decisions are in the file

This keeps the context window holding only the *current* section's discussion
(~3-5k tokens) instead of the entire document's conversation history (~30-50k tokens).

## Proactive Compaction

- **Compact proactively** at ~60-70% context usage, not reactively at the limit
- **Use `/clear`** between unrelated tasks, or after 2+ failed correction attempts
- **Natural compaction points:** after writing a section to file, after committing,
  after completing a task, before starting a new topic
- **Focused compaction:** `/compact Focus on [current task] — sections 1-3 are
  written to file, working on section 4`

## Context Budgets by Task Type

- Light (read/review): ~3k tokens startup
- Medium (implement feature): ~8k tokens
- Heavy (multi-system refactor): ~15k tokens

## Subagent Delegation

Use subagents for research and exploration to keep the main session clean.
Subagents run in their own context window and return only summaries:

- **Use subagents** when investigating across multiple files, exploring unfamiliar code,
  or doing research that would consume >5k tokens of file reads
- **Use direct reads** when you know exactly which 1-2 files to check
- Subagents do not inherit conversation history — provide full context in the prompt

## Compaction Instructions

When context is compacted, preserve the following in the summary:

- List of files modified in this session and their purpose
- Any architectural decisions made and their rationale
- Active sprint tasks and their current status
- Agent invocations and their outcomes (success/failure/blocked)
- Test results (pass/fail counts, specific failures)
- Unresolved blockers or questions awaiting user input
- The current task and what step we are on
- Which sections of the current document are written to file vs. still in progress

**After compaction:** Re-read files being actively worked on to recover full context.

## Recovery After Session Crash

If a session dies or you start a new session to continue work:

1. The `session-start.sh` hook shows branch, recent commits, and project context
2. Re-read the files you were working on
3. Continue from the next incomplete step
