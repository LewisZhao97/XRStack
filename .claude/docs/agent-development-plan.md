### Phase 1 — Complete ✅
Foundation, all 30 agents, 43 skills, 25 rules, 8+2 hooks, 18 templates, 3 scripts, session management, continuous learning system, verification loop, eval harness, brainstorm/design-review workflows.

### Phase 2 — Near-term (XR depth)
Add `/xr-comfort-check`, `/scene-audit`, `/shader-review` skills. Add `openxr-runtime.md` and `sdk-api.md` rules. Add `.meta` file and `.asmdef` validation hooks.

### Phase 3 — Medium-term (platform maturity)
Add `/platform-cert`, `/sdk-release`, `/migrate-unity` skills. Add `ar-specialist` and `multiplayer-xr-specialist` agents. Create platform feature matrix documentation for XR glasses and PC streaming.

### Phase 4 — Long-term (CI/CD and automation)
Add `ci-cd-unity-specialist` agent. Integrate with Unity Cloud Build or GameCI. Add automated performance regression hooks. Add shader variant budget enforcement.
