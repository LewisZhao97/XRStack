# XRStack Harness Test Plan

> **⚠️ OUT OF DATE**: This plan was written against the 43-skill inventory. The skill set has since been trimmed to 31 (see [skills-reference.md](skills-reference.md)). Test cases for removed skills — `/perf-profile`, `/estimate`, `/scope-check`, `/milestone-review`, `/gate-check`, `/hotfix`, `/localize`, `/prune`, `/instinct-import`, `/instinct-export`, `/skill-create`, `/strategic-compact`, `/team-release`, `/release-checklist` — should be skipped or replaced with `/milestone-gate` where applicable.
>
> **Purpose**: Systematically test all harness components (30 skills, 30 agents, 25 rules, 8 hooks, 18 templates) using a single empty Unity project and one continuous scenario.
>
> **Scenario**: Build a simple "XR Object Grabber" — a minimal XR app where the user grabs and throws cubes. Small enough to complete, complex enough to exercise the full harness.
>
> **Prerequisites**:
> - Unity 6.x installed with Android + Windows build support
> - XR Interaction Toolkit (XRI) package installed
> - OpenXR package installed
> - Node.js installed (for session scripts)
> - Empty Unity project created (just default scene)

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap (Session Start)

**Goal**: Verify the harness boots correctly in an empty project and detects its state.

### Steps

| # | Action | Tests | Expected Result | Pass? |
|---|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| 0.1 | Open a new Claude Code session in the empty Unity project | **Hooks**: `session-start.sh`, `detect-gaps.sh` | Session context printed (branch, commits). Gap detection runs and reports "NEW PROJECT" or missing items | |
| 0.2 | Run `/start-harness` | **Skill**: `start-harness` | Discovers Unity version, render pipeline, XR packages. Audits CLAUDE.md (or offers to generate one). Presents routing menu (A/B/C/D) | |
| 0.3 | Run `/project-stage-detect` | **Skill**: `project-stage-detect` | Detects project stage (likely "Pre-production" or "Setup"). Lists gaps and recommends next steps | |
| 0.4 | Verify all 25 rules are loaded | **Rules**: all 25 (auto-loaded) | Check that CLAUDE.md references the rules. Coding style, XR constraints, testing requirements should be active in responses | |

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] `session-start.sh` printed branch + recent commits
- [ ] `detect-gaps.sh` ran without errors
- [ ] `/start-harness` detected Unity version and XR packages (or noted their absence)
- [ ] `/project-stage-detect` produced a stage report
- [ ] Rules are influencing behavior (test: ask Claude to write a variable — should use `m_` prefix)

---

## Phase 1 — Design

| 1.3 | Run `/architecture-decision` with: "Choose between XRI direct interactor vs custom grab system" | **Skill**: `architecture-decision` | ADR document with context, alternatives, consequences. References **Template**: `architecture-decision-record.md` | |
| 1.4 | Run `/estimate` with: "Estimate effort for the XR grab-and-throw implementation plan" | **Skill**: `estimate` | Structured estimate with complexity analysis, risk factors, confidence levels | |
| 1.5 | Write a brief GDD for the grabber feature, then run `/design-review` on it | **Skill**: `design-review`, **Agent**: `producer` | Reviews for completeness, consistency, implementability. References **Templates**: `game-design-document.md`, `game-concept.md`, `technical-design-document.md` | |

### Validation Criteria

- `sdk-developer` — Needs SDK package at `Packages/com.*.xr.sdk/`
- `unity-dots-specialist` — Needs ECS/DOTS code
- `unity-addressables-specialist` — Needs Addressable asset groups
- `analytics-engineer` — Needs telemetry/analytics work

> These 5 agents serve specialized domains. To test them, add a mini-step: ask Claude a question in each domain and verify routing. No implementation needed.

## Execution Notes

### Session Strategy

This plan spans **~50+ interactions**. You have three options:

1. **Single marathon session** — Run all phases sequentially. Context will compact around Phase 4-5. Use `/save-session` before compaction points.

2. **Multi-session** (recommended) — Split into 3 sessions:
   - Session A: Phases 0–2 (Bootstrap → Implement)
   - Session B: Phases 3–5 (Quality → Learning)
   - Session C: Phases 6–8 (Maintenance → Release)
   - Use `/save-session` at end of each, `/sessions load` at start of next

3. **Cherry-pick** — Test specific phases independently. Phase 0 must always run first.

### Grading

For each step, record:

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| PASS | Skill/hook/agent worked as documented |
| PARTIAL | Ran but output was incomplete or had minor issues |
| FAIL | Error, didn't trigger, or wrong behavior |
| SKIP | Couldn't test (missing dependency, context limit) |

### Known Limitations

- **Build/compile phases** (verification-loop Phase 1-2, build-platform) require Unity Editor accessible via CLI. If `UNITY_PATH` is not set, these will SKIP.
- **PlayMode tests** require Unity Editor running.
- **XR performance profiling** produces estimates from code analysis, not runtime profiler data, unless connected to Unity MCP.
- **Orchestration skills** (`team-release`, `team-ui`) spawn multiple agents — costs are higher and may hit rate limits.
- **Continuous learning hooks** (observe.sh) require manual setup in `settings.json` — they're optional and won't fire unless configured.

### Tracking Results

Create a simple results file as you go:
