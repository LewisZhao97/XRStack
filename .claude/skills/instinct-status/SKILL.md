# Instinct Status Command

Shows learned instincts for the current project plus global instincts, grouped by domain.

## Implementation

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py status
```

## Usage

```
/instinct-status
```

## What to Do

1. Detect current project context (git remote/path hash)
2. Read project instincts from `~/.claude/homunculus/projects/<project-id>/instincts/`
3. Read global instincts from `~/.claude/homunculus/instincts/`
4. Merge with precedence rules (project overrides global when IDs collide)
5. Display grouped by domain with confidence bars and observation stats

## Output Format
